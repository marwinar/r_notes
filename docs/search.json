A way to handle this, is with the function complete from tidyr.\nAn example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nset.seed(123)\n\nsample_data &lt;- expand.grid(participant=1:5, beep=1:10)\nsample_data$score &lt;- runif(50, 0, 100)\n\n# Remove 10% of the data randomly\nsample_data &lt;- slice_sample(sample_data, prop = .7) %&gt;% \n  arrange(participant, beep)\n\nslice_head(sample_data, n = 15)\n\n   participant beep    score\n1            1    2  4.55565\n2            1    3 95.68333\n3            1    4 89.98250\n4            1    5 88.95393\n5            1    6 70.85305\n6            1    7 96.30242\n7            1    8 47.77960\n8            1   10 13.88061\n9            2    1 78.83051\n10           2    2 52.81055\n11           2    3 45.33342\n12           2    4 24.60877\n13           2    5 69.28034\n14           2    6 54.40660\n15           2    7 90.22990\n\n\nIn this dataset there are no real missings – every cell in the table is filled with data, but there are missing beeps.\n\nsample_with_explicit_missings &lt;- sample_data %&gt;% \n  tidyr::complete(participant, beep)\n\nslice_head(sample_with_explicit_missings, n = 15)\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 3\n   participant  beep score\n         &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1           1     1 NA   \n 2           1     2  4.56\n 3           1     3 95.7 \n 4           1     4 90.0 \n 5           1     5 89.0 \n 6           1     6 70.9 \n 7           1     7 96.3 \n 8           1     8 47.8 \n 9           1     9 NA   \n10           1    10 13.9 \n11           2     1 78.8 \n12           2     2 52.8 \n13           2     3 45.3 \n14           2     4 24.6 \n15           2     5 69.3"

For a simple one-person project I don’t feel the need to work with branches, but for anything that grows in complexity I use (part of) git flow: master, develop, feature branches and hotfixes (and if necessary releases as well).\nGit works pretty well straight from RStudio, but SourceTree has nicer visuals and more features. And then there is of course also the command-line git bash. Rules of thumb: commit early, commit often, and don’t be afraid to refactor and clean up."

I admit: even after many years of programming I still name my variables temp every once in a while…). My basic rules of thumb with regards to naming are: informative names, snake_case, verbs for functions (e.g. “shake_paw”). Snake case is also recommended by (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023).\nWith regards to pipes, I have always used the classic magrittr pipe %&gt;%, but am thinking of changing my habits to |&gt; after reading this argument. On the other hand, there are a few crucial differences between the base pipe |&gt; and the magrittr pipe %&gt;% that I cannot really oversee at the moment."

    "text": "4.3 Rmd, quarto, etc\nMy first experiences with R go back to 2002 I think. At the time we just used the plain R console, and that already felt very impressive. Later came ESS (emacs speaks statistics), and that made things much easier even though I always kept mixing up the keyboard shortcuts. Code documentation was in comments. And then some years later Sweave came :). Finally it was possible to keep thoughts and code and results in one place and distribute it as a single document. I really, REALLY liked that at the time.\nWhen after a long break away from R I rediscovered R again, I found RMarkdown (rmd). It still had all the good things Sweave already provided, but was much easier and had a better workflow. I made a sidestep to Jupyter when I toyed around with Python, but Rmd was my favorite tool of choice. Only recently I switched to Quarto, just another tool in the long list of tools, nothing really shocking, but newer, neater and better :). The point I want to make is that the tool in itself doesn’t matter (tools come and go…); it’s all about finding something that works to keep thoughts flowing and tell a story.\n\n4.3.1 Quarto\nUse Cross references in Quarto to create links to sections, figures, tables, formulas etcetera."
