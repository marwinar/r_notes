    "text": "2.1 Invisible missing data in longitudinal datasets\nA noteworthy case is how to handle “invisible” missing data, for example in experience sampling data where participants have missed a couple of beeps that are simply not listed in the dataset. A way to handle this, is with the function complete from tidyr.\nAn example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nsample_data &lt;- expand.grid(participant=1:5, beep=1:10)\nsample_data$score &lt;- runif(50, 0, 100)\n\n# Remove 10% of the data randomly\nsample_data &lt;- slice_sample(sample_data, prop = .7) %&gt;% \n  arrange(participant, beep)\n\nslice_head(sample_data, n = 15)\n\n   participant beep      score\n1            1    1 56.1024511\n2            1    3 62.6642882\n3            1    4 34.9209344\n4            1    5 84.0741702\n5            1    7 43.6799469\n6            1    8  0.7111708\n7            1   10 71.9164091\n8            2    1 30.1353585\n9            2    2 94.9741691\n10           2    3 80.1323525\n11           2    5 21.0220744\n12           2    6  5.9390293\n13           2    9 65.6030887\n14           3    1 93.0685017\n15           3    3 49.9526870\n\n\nIn this dataset there are no real missings – every cell in the table is filled with data, but there are missing beeps.\n\nsample_with_explicit_missings &lt;- sample_data %&gt;% \n  tidyr::complete(participant, beep)\n\nslice_head(sample_with_explicit_missings, n = 15)\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 3\n   participant  beep  score\n         &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1           1     1 56.1  \n 2           1     2 NA    \n 3           1     3 62.7  \n 4           1     4 34.9  \n 5           1     5 84.1  \n 6           1     6 NA    \n 7           1     7 43.7  \n 8           1     8  0.711\n 9           1     9 NA    \n10           1    10 71.9  \n11           2     1 30.1  \n12           2     2 95.0  \n13           2     3 80.1  \n14           2     4 NA    \n15           2     5 21.0  \n\n\nThe missing scores have now become explicit and are visible as NA.\n\nlibrary(naniar)\n\nWarning: package 'naniar' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\ngg_miss_var(sample_with_explicit_missings, facet = participant)\n\n\n\n\nTidyr also has a function fill to “fill down” missing data, i.e. fill the empty values in a column with the last non-empty value above it.\n\n\n\n\nTierney, Nicholas, and Dianne Cook. 2023. “Expanding Tidy Data Principles to Facilitate Missing Data Exploration, Visualization and Assessment of Imputations.” Journal of Statistical Software 105 (7): 1–31. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v105.i07.\n\n\nTierney, Nicholas, and Allison Horst. 2022.

    "text": "3.1 Version control\nMy toolkit with regards to version control is pretty simple. I use git with a local repo on my computer and a remote on github. For a simple one-person project I don’t feel the need to work with branches, but for anything that grows in complexity I use (part of) git flow: master, develop, feature branches and hotfixes (and if necessary releases as well).\nGit works pretty well straight from RStudio, but SourceTree has nicer visuals and more features. And then there is of course also the command-line git bash. Rules of thumb: commit early, commit often, and don’t be afraid to refactor and clean up."

    "text": "3.3 Rmd, quarto, etc\nMy first experiences with R go back to 2002 I think. At the time we just used the plain R console, and that already felt very impressive. Later came ESS (emacs speaks statistics), and that made things much easier even though I always kept mixing up the keyboard shortcuts. Code documentation was in comments. And then some years later Sweave came :). Finally it was possible to keep thoughts and code and results in one place and distribute it as a single document. I really, REALLY liked that at the time.\nWhen after a long break away from R I rediscovered R again, I found RMarkdown (rmd). It still had all the good things Sweave already provided, but was much easier and had a better workflow. I made a sidestep to Jupyter when I toyed around with Python, but Rmd was my favorite tool of choice. Only recently I switched to Quarto, just another tool in the long list of tools, nothing really shocking, but newer, neater and better :). The point I want to make is that the tool in itself doesn’t matter (tools come and go…); it’s all about finding something that works to keep thoughts flowing and tell a story."

Plain old paper books were easier – I felt it was easier to remember which book and which chapter had a certain piece of information.\nI guess this current project is my attempt to get a bit of structure in the chaos? Time will tell if it works…"
